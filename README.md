# RT-predict
QSRR Prediction of LC Retention Time

Streamlit apps that allow a user to create simple ML models of chemical structure (as SMILES strings) and LC retention time (RT) for subsequent prediction of RT for unknown structures.

Modelling based on molecular descriptors generated by RDKit.

## rt_app.py
A Streamlit app for model training, tuning, and RT prediction with manual control.

## rt_app_simple.py
A Streamlit app for model training, tuning, and RT prediction for non-expert users. Automatically chooses and tunes the best model from Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.

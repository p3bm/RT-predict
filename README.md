# RT-predict
QSRR Prediction of LC Retention Time

Streamlit apps that allow a user to create simple ML models of chemical structure (as SMILES strings) and LC retention time (RT) for subsequent prediction of RT for unknown structures.

Modelling based on molecular descriptors generated by RDKit.

## TODO
+ Alter modelling app to produce graphs for all models so that they can be compared side-by-side.
+ Combine both Streamlit apps into a single app.
+ Create instructions and simplify user interface.
+ Add information about how it works and how to avoid overfitting, etc.
